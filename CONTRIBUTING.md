## Opening an issue

## Testing your new features

After cloning the repository you should install the dependencies by using

```shell
$ yarn install
```

You have to create an OAuth application from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
After creating your application create a bot and enable `Server Members Intent` and `Message Content Intent` from
`Privileged Gateway Intents`.


Copy the `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`, fill all variables correspondingly. Run the command below to sync your
db with the current `schema.prisma`.

```shell
$ yarn run sync
```

And you're done! You can test your changes with the bot.

> ⚠ DON'T FORGET TO SET YOUR `NODE_ENV` TO `development`
